#Description and Rationale

This project is my version of a hyperdocument system, largely based on the ideas of Doug Engelbart. I wrote a brief summary of who he was with links to learn more [here](https://github.com/smarks159/hyperdocument-system-wiki/wiki/DougEngelbartIntro)

There are two main ideas of Doug Engelbart that were really appealing to me:

###Efficient User Interface
The first idea is the idea of an efficient user interface. My aim is to build tools that I use everyday to make myself more productive. For my needs, I found that most of the gui interfaces were clunky to use and focused on being easy to learn. The alternatives are usually to do away with a gui interface and focus on a more text like interface for efficiency purposes. The problem is that computer is capable of so much more that just text.  I want to build tools that are at least as efficient to use as text and take full advantage of what a computer is capable of.

###Bootstrapping
The second idea, that is even more important, is Engelbart's approach to solving problems called bootstrapping. The problem that this approach aims to address is that technology and the problems associated with it increase at an exponential rate while humans ability to solve these problems do not, especially as the number of people involved increases. This is true in the field of software development and even worse in bioinformatics, the field in which I work. The solution to this problem requires a fundamental shift in the way in which we think and approach problems. Engelbart invented such an a approach and used in to invent many of the technologies related to modern day computers that we use today. This project project is an experiment in applying the conceptual framework Engelbart developed to try and address these problems. I intend on writing more about what I have learned about applying these ideas.
 

#Current Status
Currently the code is experimental, but I use the system frequently and find it useful. Currently, the most useful thing I find it useful for is for taking notes instead of using a text editor.

# Project Code
There are two parts to this project a web based client written in javascript [located here](https://github.com/smarks159/hyperdocument-system-js-client) and a server written in go [located here](https://github.com/smarks159/hyperdocument-system-go-server). 

To use the program first download and install the server and then download the client code as specified in the instructions in each repository.

# Forum
I set up a google group [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hyperdocumentsystem) to talk about this project or any of the ideas relating to it.

# Tutorial
I have written a brief tutorial that goes through some of the basics of the system [here](https://github.com/smarks159/hyperdocument-system-wiki/wiki/tutorial)
