#Description

This project is my version of a hyperdocument system, largely based on the ideas of Doug Engelbart. I wrote a brief summary of who he was with links to learn more [here](DougEngelbartIntro)

Currently this system can be used as a basic structured text editor. The features are limited and the code is experimental. But, I use this system all the time and feel that its reached a point where other people might find it useful as well. I will continue to grow and evolve the system as I keep using it. 

Another goal of this project is to try and expose the ideas of Doug Engelbart to more people, they are extremely important and deserve more attention. I plan on writing more about these ideas and what I have learned about them while working on this project. Hopefully having concrete examples to point will help in understanding these ideas. These ideas are more important than this one small project.
 

# Project Code
There are two parts to this project a web based client written in javascript [located here]() and a server written in go [located here](). 

To use the program first download and install the server and then download the client code as specified in the instructions in each repository.

# Tutorial
I have written a brief tutorial that goes through some of the basics of the system [here](tutorial)
