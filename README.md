#Description

This is an experimental version of a hyperdocument system based on the ideas of [Doug Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart). Doug Engelbart invented many of the technologies that we use related to the web and collaborative development. The overall purpose that these technolgies were invented for, however, has been mostly forgotten over time. That purpose is [boosting our Collective IQ](http://www.dougengelbart.org/about/vision-highlights.html).

What is Collective IQ? It is the ability of humans, as a group, to adapt to the changing world around them by identifying problems and taking the correct course of action to solve these problems. The more people involved the worse we get at solving problems. I am sure that you have encountered problems that took way longer than they should have due to inefficienies of working in a large group, the bigger the group the bigger this problem becomes. These problems are made even worse by the fact the challenges brought about by the change in all technologies related to computers are increasing at an exponential rate. 

Doug Engelbart recognized this problem early on and saw that computers could provide the enabling technology to overcome this problem. To that end Doug Engelbart created a conceptual framework called the "bootstrap framework". This framework outlines a fundamentally different way of working together that scales to a large number of people and not only enables them to work together efficiently, but to increase that effectiveness at an exponential rate. A hyperdocument system is Doug Engelbart's vision of the technology that would support this way of working.  The hardest part in this is getting people to change the way they work together in the first place due to the exact same problem that Doug Engelbart was trying to solve.

There is a lot more information about these ideas at the [Doug Engelbart Institute website](http://www.dougengelbart.org/).

The goal behind this project is to gain a better understanding of these ideas and figure out how to take a small step forward towards this goal. Even a small step forward towards this goal can have a large impact on the world. 


#Current Status:
Currently I have a working version of a primitive hyperdocument system. The system is stable and there is enough to demonstrate so core principles, but it is missing many key features. You can view the user document for a list of some of the implemented features.

#Future Plans:
I plan on working on this project in my spare time and will document what I learn. The goal is to educate myself and others about these important ideas and figure out what it would take to implement such a system.

These core ideas and techniques could then be used to build more specific applications in the future.

# Project Code
There are two parts to this project a web based client written in javascript [located here](https://github.com/smarks159/hyperdocument-system-js-client) and a server written in go [located here](https://github.com/smarks159/hyperdocument-system-go-server). 

To install download or checkout the client code first and the build the server as specified in the instructions in the project.

# Forum
I set up a google group [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hyperdocumentsystem) to talk about this project or any of the ideas relating to it.

#User Documentation
User Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/smarks159/hyperdocument-system-wiki/wiki/userdocs_toc).
